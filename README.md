https://pypi.org/project/gpxpy/

Gpx-lite is a simplified version of gpxpy, aimed to load and save data about gpx tracks, segments,
and points from/to xml, including large .gpx files, quickly enough.

Resulting GPX structure contains track list - list of track segments made of track points with latitude, 
longitude, and time.
